 * Dependency Inversion Principle :-

 *      Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions."
 *
 * Here, Parent module (i.e. High level module) is Calculator class is directly dependent on
 * Low level modules (i.e. AddOperation, SubtractOperation, etc.).
 * Also, Details are dependent on actual classes (which as per principle should depend on abstraction)
 *
 * Hence, DI Principle is broken here.
